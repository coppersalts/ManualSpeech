# ManualSpeech
A completely adjustable and manual speech synthesizer. ManualSpeech is made in JavaScript using the Web Audio API, and uses no additional libraries. To run it for yourself, just download the files and open `index.html` in a browser. Or, preferably using the GitHub Pages site [here](https://coppersalts.github.io/ManualSpeech).
