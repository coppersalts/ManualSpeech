# ManualSpeech
A completely adjustable and manual speech synthesizer. ManualSpeech is made in JavaScript using the Web Audio API, and uses no additional libraries. To run it for yourself, just download the files and open `index.html` in a browser. Or, preferably, just go to the GitHub Pages site [here](https://coppersalts.github.io/ManualSpeech).

The projects is currently still in its early stages, and many new features are planned.
